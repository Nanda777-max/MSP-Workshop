Session conducted by Thameem.
It first began by giving the download link of the desktop app Github.
It then included the comparison of the control systems : Version and Distributed.
Version Control System keeps track of changes to files and helps to manage them.
Distributed Control System has no central server and everyone can make changes without internet access.
Then an overview of how git works was given.
Snapshots were explained as how git keeps track of our code history.
Commit is the act of creating a Snapshot.
Repositories are a collection of files.
All commits live on some branch.
Then some commands were later discussed.
